# Appy Time

I'm building a Flutter app that tracks the time users spend in each app on their mobile device. The
app lets users set limits for how long they want to use specific apps and sends notifications when
they exceed those limits.

## Features

1.App Usage Tracker
Track how long each app is used daily.
Show total screen time per day/week.

2.Custom Limits
Let users set time limits for specific apps.
Show a countdown or time left.

3.Notifications
Warn users when they are close to or over their limit.
Send motivational or funny reminders.

4.Daily & Weekly Reports
Simple dashboard of usage stats.
Graphs showing trends.
